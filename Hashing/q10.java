/*
    Sort by Frequency
    Given a strings,sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters.
    The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.Return the sorted string.
    If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
    Sample Input 1: s = "cccaaa"
    Sample Output 1: "aaaccc"Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
    Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
    Sample Input 2: s = "tree"
    Sample Output 2:"eert"'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'.
    Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer
